# Traffic-Simulation-ABM
Freeway Traffic Simulation using the Nagel–Schreckenberg cellular automaton model and Agent-Based-Modelling.
The ABM framework that I use is Python [mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview.html).

The Nagel–Schreckenberg model is a theoretical model for simulating road traffic flow that can reproduce traffic jams. This way, we can explain "out of nowhere"-traffic jams.
